Ink is a backend for the Elixir `Logger` with two main purposes:

- to log JSON documents instead of normal log lines
- to filter secret strings out of the log lines

## Installation

Just add `:ink` to your dependencies and run `mix deps.get`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ink, "~> 1.3"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

The only thing you have to do is drop some lines into your config.

```elixir
# this will add Ink as the only backend for Logger
config :logger,
  backends: [Ink]

# at least configure a name for your app
config :logger, Ink,
  name: "your app"
```

For more information on how to use `Ink`, take a look
at [the docs](https://hexdocs.pm/ink/Ink.html).

## Maintenance

- get dependencies with `mix deps.get`
